# OD-big-data-processing-algorithm
This is a simple algorithm script for processing OD traffic big data. If your data exceeds one million or hundreds of millions, it will be very troublesome to use Excel to process the data, and even the excel cannot be opened or the computer will crash. At this time It is better to write an algorithm code to process the data.

The code of the second version of this warehouse implements 5 functions, which can be used to count the amount of data and empty data, calculate the total average commuting distance/commuting distance of the city, the average commuting distance/commuting distance in the city,

Average commuting distance/commuting distance between different cities, and cumulative average commuting distance/commuting distance between different cities
