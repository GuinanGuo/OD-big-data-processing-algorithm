# OD-big-data-processing-algorithm
This is a simple algorithm script for processing OD traffic big data. If your data exceeds one million or hundreds of millions, it will be very troublesome to use Excel to process the data, and even the excel cannot be opened or the computer will crash. At this time It is better to write an algorithm code to process the data.

The code of the second version of this warehouse implements 5 functions, which can be used to count the amount of data and empty data, calculate the total average commuting time/commuting distance of the city, and the average commuting time/commuting distance in the city.

The average commuting time/commuting distance between different cities, and the cumulative average commuting time/commuting distance between different cities.

The data is read in the form of a CSV file, and the result of data processing is written into a new txt file.
